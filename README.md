## Overview

The `mermaider` is an MCP server that provides `validate_syntax` tool that checks all Mermaid diagram types for syntax errors.

For that, it uses [`puppeteer-core` package][2] and [`mermaid-js/mermaid` API][3] directly to **efficiently** use already installed Chrome-based or Firefox browser.

Efficiently means:

- The browser (with a new page) is opened and kept running headless (by default) for as long as this MCP server process is active â€“ to achieve low-latency tool calls.
- Every `validate_syntax` tool call reuses the browser and the page.

### Why using the browser at all?

Unfortunately, [`mermaid-js/mermaid`][3] relies on full browser context (DOM) for its functionality, even for parsing the diagrams. Packages like [happy-dom][4] or [jsdom][5] do not quite cut it.

The `mermaider` uses relatively light-weight [`puppeteer-core` package][2] (as opposed to full `puppeteer`) to access already installed browser.

## The LLMs syntax problem

Modern LLMs typically are perfectly capable of generating Mermaid diagrams, however often lack ability to reliably check the generated syntax. This is where the `mermaider` MCP comes in.

## What makes `mermaider` different?

There are other [MCPs](#other-mermaid-related-mcp-servers) that can (sort of) validate Mermaid syntax, however, they typically work by launching [`mmdc` command-line utility][1] process every time respective tool is invoked (by the LLM).

That brings a few issues:

- **Speed**: spawning `mmdc` process, which (then itself launches the browser) for every tool call is slow and expensive.
- **Non-determinism**: `mmdc`'s purpose really is to generate images, not validate syntax. As such, occasionally it exits with 0 code and generates an image (like one below) for diagrams with broken syntax as opposed to exiting with non-zero code and spitting out an error message to `STDERR`. In this case, MCP server that uses `mmdc` would have no idea the error occurred so you end up with a bunch of these images instead of your diagrams.

- **Side Effects**: `mmdc` [may install Chrome browser](https://pptr.dev/guides/installation) unbeknownst to you as that is the default puppeteer's behaviour, quote:

  >When you install Puppeteer, it automatically downloads a recent version of Chrome for Testing (~170MB macOS, ~282MB Linux, ~280MB Windows) and a chrome-headless-shell binary (starting with Puppeteer v21.6.0) that is guaranteed to work with Puppeteer. The browser is downloaded to the $HOME/.cache/puppeteer folder by default (starting with Puppeteer v19.0.0). See configuration for configuration options and environmental variables to control the download behavior.

## Installation

In general, below is the command that your MCP client should use:

```bash
npx -y @vtomilin/mermaider <config>
```

Where `<config>` is either an inline `JSON` string, or a config file path, e.g.

```bash
npx -y @vtomilin/mermaider '{"executablePath": "/Applications/FirefoxDeveloperEdition.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox", "browser": "firefox"}'
```

Or:

```bash
npx -y @vtomilin/mermaider /home/user/etc/Firefox.json
```

Where `/home/user/etc/Firefox.json` is a JSON file containing the configuration, for example, for Firefox browser:

```json
{
  "executablePath": "/Applications/FirefoxDeveloperEdition.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox",
  "browser": "firefox"
}
```

Another config file example, using the Brave (Chrome-based) browser:

```json
{
  "executablePath": "/Applications/Brave Browser.app/Contents/MacOS/Brave Browser"
}

```

Complete list of available Browser configuration options defined in Puppeteer's Browser [`Launchoptions`](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.launchoptions).

### VSCode

Press `Cmd-Shift-P` (or `Ctrl-Shift-P`), then `MCP: Add Server...`. Select `Command (stdio) Run a local command that implements the MCP protocol`. Enter `npx -y @vtomilin/mermaider /home/user/etc/Firefox.json` (or whatever config method). Enter the server name (`mermaider`). And you should be all set.

### Cursor/Windsuf/...

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mermaider": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@vtomilin/mermaider", "/home/user/etc/Firefox.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Bun

Even though this project is built with Bun the `mermaider` package can not be run directly with `bunx` at the moment. You would have to install the package globally with `bun add -d @vtomilin/mermaider` first. Then you can just use `mermaider-bun` executable to run the server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mermaider": {
      "command": "mermaider-bun",
      "args": ["/home/user/etc/Firefox.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Recommendations

- Check [Puppeteer's Supported Browsers List](https://pptr.dev/supported-browsers) for supported browsers.
- Use a secondary browser for `mermaider` MCP. Do not use your primary browser.

## Usage Examples

Example sessions using Github Copilot in VSCode:

- Generating a diagram and checking its syntax with `mermaider`:
  ![Correct Syntax](assets/use-sample.png)

- Generating an intentionally broken diagram and checking its syntax with `mermaider`:
![Invalid Syntax](assets/sample-error.png)
